            <p class="text"><span class="word_t">T</span>his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was
                travelling.
                About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The
                locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals
                was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
                bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can
                moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.
            </p>
            <p class="text1">The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who
                had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until
                it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way.
                Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of
                revolvers upon them.</p>
            <p class="text1">"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession,
                just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this
                mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this
                herd of beasts!"</p>
